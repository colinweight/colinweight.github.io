A while back, myself and another [developer](https://github.com/sporto) were about to start working on two projects that had a fairly large crossover in requirements, but for different business models. The two clients were related in a business sense too, so we could be completely open about the commonality and the theory was that we could use this common ground as a win/win. (note, for various reasons the projects fell through, but this is a dev blog, not a politics and money blog, so we'll stick to the good stuff)
