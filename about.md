Welcome!

My name is Colin, and I'm a [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) developer based in Melbourne, Australia.
I work mostly in Ruby on Rails. I started later in life than most, having made my way here via music and tech support. Living many years (well, not *that* many...) as a normal person gives me a different perspective, and I hope my blog will bring that out. If not, hopefully there's something useful here anyway!

Enjoy.
